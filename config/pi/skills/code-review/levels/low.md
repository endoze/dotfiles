`low effort → 1 diff pass → no verify → ≤4 findings`
## Turn 1 — read
One tool call: read the unified diff (`jj diff --from 'trunk()' --to '@'`,
which covers committed and in-progress changes in one range, or the target
passed as an argument: `gh pr diff <n>`, or `jj diff -r <rev>`). Skip
test/fixture hunks (`test/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`, `*_test.*`, `*.test.*`,
`fixtures/`, `testdata/`) — test-file changes are not reviewed at this level.
No subagents, no full-file reads.
## Turn 2 — findings
Flag runtime-correctness bugs visible from the hunk alone: inverted/wrong
condition, off-by-one, null/undefined deref where adjacent lines show the value
can be absent, removed guard, falsy-zero check, missing `await`,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in a catch that should propagate.
Also flag — still from the hunk alone — new code that duplicates an existing
helper visible in the diff context, and dead code the diff leaves behind.
Do **not** flag style, naming, perf, missing tests, or anything outside the
hunk.
Output at most **4 findings**, most-severe first, one line each:
`path/to/file.ext:123 — what's wrong and the concrete failure`. If nothing
qualifies, output exactly `(none)`. Do not call the
ReportFindings tool even if it is available.
